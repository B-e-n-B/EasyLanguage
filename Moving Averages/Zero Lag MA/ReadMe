-What is lag?
In the context of moving averages, "lag" is the delay between changes in actual data and the movement of the moving average line. 
For instance, if you are useing a 10-period (The period being minutes, hours, or days) moving average, you are getting the average price of the last 10 periods;
if the data suddenly changes, the moving average wouldnt fluctuate as much because it is still using older data to calculate the moving average line...this is called lag.

-How does the Zero Lag Moving Avgerage (ZLMA) attempt to fix this?
The ZLMA is john Ehlers' creation for the purpose of reducing lag (obviosly) which is present in other moving averages.
The way Ehlers does this is by removing the data from "lag" days ago thus removing (or attempting to) the cumulative effect of the moving average.
