-What is the Volume Weighted Moving Average?
The Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA) is a technical analysis tool used to smooth out price data and highlight trends by giving more weight to periods with higher trading volume. 
It's similar to the Simple Moving Average (SMA), but while SMA gives equal weight to each period, VWMA assigns more importance to periods with higher volume.
