-What is the Hann Moving average?
The Hanning Moving Average, is a type of moving average that incorporates the Hann (or Hanning) window function into its calculation.
The Hann window is a type of tapering window function used in signal processing and data analysis to reduce spectral leakage when performing operations such as filtering and smoothing.

-What is spectral leakage?
Spectral leakage is a phenomenon in signal processing where energy from a specific frequency component "leaks" into other frequency-
components when performing operations such as Fourier analysis or filtering.
It occurs due to the finite duration (or windowing) of the signal being analyzed.

-How does windowing fix this?
Windowing helps fix spectral leakage by tapering the signal smoothly to zero at its endpoints before performing spectral analysis.
In signal processing, windowing functions, such as the Hann, Hamming, or Blackman-Harris windows, gradually reduce the amplitude of the signal near its edges.
This tapering minimizes the impact of discontinuities and reduces spectral leakage.

Note:  1. This can be applied to any Symbol and any asset class as long as there is a time-series containing OHLC data
  	   2. This can be applied to any timeframe Ex: 1min chart, 20min chart, 1hour chart, Daily chart
  	 	 3. This must be set up as INDICATOR
