-What is lag?
In the context of moving averages, "lag" is the delay between changes in actual data and the movement of the moving average line.
For instance, if you are using a 10-period (The period being minutes, hours, or days) moving average, you are getting the average price of the last 10 periods;
if the data suddenly changes, the moving average wouldn't fluctuate as much because it is still using older data to calculate the moving average line...this is called lag.

-What is the Hull Moving average?
The Hull Moving Average (HMA) was developed by Alan Hull and first introduced in his book "Active Investing" in 2005.
The HMA attempts to address the shortcomings of traditional moving averages by reducing lag and providing smoother signals.
