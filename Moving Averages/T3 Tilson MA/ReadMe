The T3 Tillson Moving Average is an extension of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) designed to reduce lag and provide smoother signals for trends compared to traditional moving averages.
It was developed by Tim Tillson and introduced in the Stocks and Commodities magazine in 1998. The "T3" stands for "Tillson's Moving Average, exponential, triple smoothed".
