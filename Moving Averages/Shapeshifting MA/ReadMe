-What is lag?
In the context of moving averages, "lag" is the delay between changes in actual data and the movement of the moving average line.
For instance, if you are using a 10-period (The period being minutes, hours, or days) moving average, you are getting the average price of the last 10 periods;
if the data suddenly changes, the moving average wouldn't fluctuate as much because it is still using older data to calculate the moving average line...this is called lag.

-What is the Shapeshifting Moving average?
The Shapeshifting MA is a moving average using a modification of the 2nd derivative of the arc tangent function as kernel (set of weights).
the kernel is parametric and allow the user to switch from a low-lag moving average where the lag can be increased/decreased to a really smooth moving average.

Note:   1. This can be applied to any Symbol and any asset class as long as there is a time-series containing OHLC data
   	    2. This can be applied to any timeframe Ex: 1min chart, 20min chart, 1hour chart, Daily chart
   	    3. This must be set up as INDICATOR
